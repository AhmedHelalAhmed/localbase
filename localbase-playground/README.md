# Localbase Playground

An app for playing around with Localbase and all the available methods.

It contains a bunch of different code snippets (for adding, updating, setting and getting) data to/from a Localbase database.

You can launch these code snippets (and edit them if you like) in the browser and observe the result in the IndexedDB database and in the console.
